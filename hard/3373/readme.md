## 3373. Maximize the Number of Target Nodes After Connecting Trees II


There exist two **undirected** trees with `n` and `m` nodes, labeled from `[0, n - 1]` and `[0, m - 1]`, respectively.


You are given two 2D integer arrays `edges1` and `edges2` of lengths `n - 1` and `m - 1`, respectively, where `edges1[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that there is an edge between nodes `ai` and `bi` in the first tree and `edges2[i] = [ui, vi]` indicates that there is an edge between nodes `ui` and `vi` in the second tree.


Node `u` is **target** to node `v` if the number of edges on the path from `u` to `v` is even. **Note** that a node is *always* **target** to itself.


Return an array of `n` integers `answer`, where `answer[i]` is the **maximum** possible number of nodes that are **target** to node `i` of the first tree if you had to connect one node from the first tree to another node in the second tree.


**Note** that queries are independent from each other. That is, for every query you will remove the added edge before proceeding to the next query.


 


**Example 1:**



**Input:** edges1 = [[0,1],[0,2],[2,3],[2,4]], edges2 = [[0,1],[0,2],[0,3],[2,7],[1,4],[4,5],[4,6]]


**Output:** [8,7,7,8,8]


**Explanation:**


* For `i = 0`, connect node 0 from the first tree to node 0 from the second tree.
* For `i = 1`, connect node 1 from the first tree to node 4 from the second tree.
* For `i = 2`, connect node 2 from the first tree to node 7 from the second tree.
* For `i = 3`, connect node 3 from the first tree to node 0 from the second tree.
* For `i = 4`, connect node 4 from the first tree to node 4 from the second tree.

**Example 2:**



**Input:** edges1 = [[0,1],[0,2],[0,3],[0,4]], edges2 = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,3]]


**Output:** [3,6,6,6,6]


**Explanation:**


For every `i`, connect node `i` of the first tree with any node of the second tree.

**Constraints:**


* `2 <= n, m <= 105`
* `edges1.length == n - 1`
* `edges2.length == m - 1`
* `edges1[i].length == edges2[i].length == 2`
* `edges1[i] = [ai, bi]`
* `0 <= ai, bi < n`
* `edges2[i] = [ui, vi]`
* `0 <= ui, vi < m`
* The input is generated such that `edges1` and `edges2` represent valid trees.
